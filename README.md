A copyright disclaimer is a statement that claims ownership of original content or discloses your use of copyrighted materials for “fair use” purposes.

You need a copyright disclaimer on your website or app if you have branding, materials, videos, images, or other creative works you own and want to express your intellectual property rights over. It can also help prevent your works of parody, commentary, or criticism from getting unfairly copyright-struck.

This disclaimer can be used on blogs, websites, images, videos, music, and even social media to establish your ownership over original content. Having this statement helps protect your work against theft.
